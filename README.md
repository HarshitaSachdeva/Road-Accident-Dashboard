## 📊 Project Overview  
The *Road Accident Analysis Dashboard* is built in *Tableau* to provide insights into accident patterns, severity, and contributing factors.  
The dashboard highlights *time-based, location-based, and severity-based trends* to help authorities and policymakers reduce accidents and improve road safety.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- To analyze *accident severity trends* (fatal, serious, slight).  
- To study *time-based patterns*: peak hours, days, and months with high accident rates.  
- To identify *locations and road types* with maximum accidents.  
- To explore *factors like weather, light conditions, and road surface* contributing to accidents.

## 📌 Key Insights  
✔️ *Weekends* and *peak office hours* have higher accident frequency.  
✔️ *Urban roads* show more accidents, while *highways* show more severe cases.  
✔️ Bad weather and poor light conditions contribute significantly to accidents.  
✔️ Majority of accidents are classified as *slight*, but fatalities remain a concern in rural/high-speed roads.
